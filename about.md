Hey there!

My name is Tanvi Malhotra, I'm a student, programmer, web developer living in New Delhi, India. I graduated from the [Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University](http://www.igdtuw.ac.in/) in 2015. 

My hobbies include spending time with my non-human animal friends, indie and electronic dance music, literature, baking, golf, swimming, puns, the Internet, and programming for the latter. In my spare time, I lovingly work on my own personal [projects](/projects/).

I mostly do PHP, javascript/jQuery and HTML & CSS; but also a bit of Python and a teeny little bit of Ruby (this is a Jekyll website, after all).

One day I'll get a dog.

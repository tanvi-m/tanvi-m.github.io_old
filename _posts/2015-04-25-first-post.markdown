So... I've got Jekyll working, and I've got my GitHub page up and running.
It's not much, but it's a start.

I have been using my weekends to tinker with 'web stuff' and 'data analytics'. I've been using a lot of [Codechef][static-showdown] as well lately. There's only so much a newbie can do in a weekend.

So much to do! I look forward to seeing where this all takes me. :tada:

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
